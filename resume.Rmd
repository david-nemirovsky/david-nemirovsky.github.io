### **Acadmeic Projects**

“Future of COVID-19: Looking at Past Pandemics”, Columbia University (Fall 2020)

Worked in group of 4 to develop website with interactive plots and maps (with up-to-date data), comparing COVID-19 new and cumulative case/death data to that of seasonal flu (Influenza B), past pandemics (H1N1 and Spanish Flu), and original coronavirus epidemic from 2003 (SARS-CoV-1). Trends were studied to assess future implications of COVID-19, and the basic reproductive rate was found to be higher than all other diseases studied. RStudio and GitHub were used in collaborative construction of the website.

“Linear Model to Explain Hate Crimes in the U.S. in 2016”, Columbia University (Fall 2020)

Worked in group of 5 to study covariates associated with hate crimes in the U.S. in 2016, construct a linear model to explain the factors highest association with hate crimes, and then compile a publishable report. The findings suggested that income inequality, percent of population with at least a high school education, and unemployment were the covariates highest associated with hate crimes. RStudio and GitHub were used in collaborative construction of the linear model and report.
