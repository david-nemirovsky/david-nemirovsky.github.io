## Welcome to My Website :-)

The main purpose of this site is for the completion of Homework #4. It contains a page about me and a flexdashboard of some really cool plots. There are some links to my GitHub account, email address, and LinkedIn profile. I hate writing [about myself](about.html) (to be honest, who doesn't?) so I'll keep everything brief. Enjoy the site!!!
