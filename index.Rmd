### About

I am currently working as an Assistant Research Biostatistician at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. A majority of my time is spent collaborating on projects that involve multiple myeloma and leukemia survival differences using various treatments, analyzing claims data of patients with prostate cancer using SEER-Medicare data, and examining chemo-induced peripheral neuropathy in patients with breast cancer. My research interests include predictive modeling through machine learning and designing clinical trials across all phases.

Currently enrolled in my final semester as an M.S. in Biostatistics student under the Theory and Methods track, I am looking to further my knowledge of statistical applications and data analytics in the realms of healthcare and public health. In May of 2019, I received my B.A. from Hunter College in both Statistics and Biochemistry, with a Yalow Honors Scholarship, while also receiving Departmental Honors in Biochemistry and the Shirley Kurmin Mazur Award in Mathematics. In May of 2021, I was awarded the FORWARD Community Practicum Fellowship from Columbia University.

### Research

**Graduate:** Conducted quantitative research for the Department of Population and Family Health at the Columbia Mailman School of Public Health on multiracial identification across various physical and mental health outcomes and covariates. Additionally, I was a research fellow for Hip Hop HEALS at Columbia University's Irving Medical Center. My research on this project included in-depth literature review on social and emotional learning (SEL) measurement scales for assessing outcomes, establishing data infrastructure, finalizing study design, and data analysis of pilot clinical trial data for efficient evaluation of intervention efficacy of the Be My Friend after-school multimedia modules administered by New York Edge.

**Undergraduate:** Conducted research for the Department of Chemistry on the removal of harmful radionuclides, such as technetium-99, which involved analytical chemistry and designing batch-study experiments.

### Projects

A few projects I've worked on during my time at Columbia include predicting heart disease using diagnostic tests, predicting survival on the infamous cruise ship, R.M.S. *Titanic*, predicting the outcome of the 2021 NCAA DI Menâ€™s Basketball Tournament, building a website which compares COVID-19 case and death data to that of past pandemics, and creating a linear model to determine covariates responsible for hate crimes within the U.S. in 2016.
