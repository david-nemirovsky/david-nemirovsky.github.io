### About

Currently enrolled as a full-time M.S. in Biostatistics student under the Theory and Methods track, I am looking to further my knowledge of statistical applications and data science in the realms of healthcare and public health. In May of 2019, I received my B.A. from Hunter College in both Statistics and Biochemistry, with a Yalow Honors Scholarship, while also receiving Departmental Honors in Biochemistry and the Shirley Kurmin Mazur Award in Mathematics. In May of 2021, I received a FORWARD Community Practicum Fellowship Award from Columbia University.

### Research

**Graduate:** Currently conducting quantitative research for the Department of Population and Family Health at the Columbia Mailman School of Public Health on multiracial identification across various physical and mental health outcomes and covariates. Additionally, I am a currently a research fellow for Hip Hop HEALS at Columbia University's Irving Medical Center. My research on this project includes in-depth literature review on social and emotional learning (SEL) measurement scales for assessing outcomes, establishing data infrastructure, finalize study design, and data analysis of pilot clinical trial data for efficient evaluation of intervention efficacy of the Be My Friend after-school multimedia modules administered by New York Edge.

**Undergraduate:** Conducted research for the Department of Chemistry on the removal of harmful radionuclides, such as technetium-99, which involved analytical chemistry and designing batch-study experiments.

I hope to further my research experience at Columbia University by contributing data analysis skills and scientific prowess to the Department of Biostatistics.

### Projects

A few projects I've worked on during my time at Columbia include predicting survival on the infamous cruise ship, R.M.S. *Titanic*, prediciting the outcome of the 2021 NCAA DI Menâ€™s Basketball Tournament, building a website which compares COVID-19 case and death data to that of past pandemics, and creating a linear model to determine covariates responsible for hate crimes within the U.S. in 2016.
