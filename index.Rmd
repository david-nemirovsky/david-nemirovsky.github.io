#### About

Currently enrolled as a full-time M.S. Biostatistics student under the Theory and Methods track, I am looking to further my knowledge of statistical applications and data science in the world of healthcare and public health. With a Yalow Honors scholarship, I received my B.A. from Hunter College in Statistics and Biochemistry in May of 2019, graduating with Departmental Honors in Biochemistry and receiving the Shirley Kurmin Mazur Award in Mathematics.


#### Research

During my undergraduate studies, I did research for the Department of Chemistry on the removal of harmful radionuclides, such as technetium-99, which involved analytical chemistry along with designing batch-study experiments. I hope to further my research experience at Columbia University by contributing my time, data analysis skills, and scientific prowess to the Department of Biostatistics.


#### Projects

Some projects I've worked on during my time at Columbia include building a website which compares COVID-19 case and death data to that of past pandemics, along with creating a linear model to determine covariates responsible for hate crimes within the U.S. in 2016. You can see more info on these in the [Projects](https://david-nemirovsky.github.io/projects.html) tab.
