### About

Currently enrolled as a full-time M.S. in Biostatistics student under the Theory and Methods track, I am looking to further my knowledge of statistical applications and data science in the realms of healthcare and public health. In May of 2019, I received my B.A. from Hunter College in both Statistics and Biochemistry, with a Yalow Honors Scholarship, while also receiving Departmental Honors in Biochemistry and the Shirley Kurmin Mazur Award in Mathematics.

### Research

During my undergraduate studies, I did research for the Department of Chemistry on the removal of harmful radionuclides, such as technetium-99, which involved analytical chemistry and designing batch-study experiments. I hope to further my research experience at Columbia University by contributing data analysis skills and scientific prowess to the Department of Biostatistics.

### Projects

A few projects I've worked on during my time at Columbia include building a website which compares COVID-19 case and death data to that of past pandemics, along with creating a linear model to determine covariates responsible for hate crimes within the U.S. in 2016. You can see more info on these in the [Projects](https://david-nemirovsky.github.io/projects.html) tab.
