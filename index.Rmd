## Welcome to My Website :^)

The main purpose of this site is for the completion of Homework #4. It contains a page [about me](about.html) and a [flexdashboard](dashboard.html) of some really cool [plots](plotly.html). There are also some links to my GitHub account, email address, and LinkedIn profile in the navigation bar if you would like to contact me. I hate writing about myself (to be honest, who doesn't?) so I'll keep everything brief. Enjoy the site!!!
