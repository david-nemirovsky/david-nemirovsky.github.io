## Predicting the Outcome of the 2021 NCAA DI Men’s Basketball Tournament

Download Report: [Predicting the 2020-2021 NCAA DI Men’s Basketball Tournament](tourney_proj.pdf)

Overview: Worked individually to train machine learning models to predict the winner of the 2021 Men’s DI College Basketball Championship. Past years’ regular season and tournament data were used for cross-validation (CV) and ROCs were compared to build an optimized model. Functions were then created to run a simulation of the tournament, using the optimized model.

Data: Collected from Kaggle's "March Machine Learning Mania 2021 - NCAAM" competition.

Results: Using a logistic regression through 10-fold CV, Gonzaga will win the 2020-2021 DI Men's Basketball Championship.

Software: RStudio was used in construction of the models and simulation.

## Comparing COVID-19 to Past Pandemics

Link: [Future of COVID-19: Looking at Past Pandemics](https://p-sha.github.io/covid19_future.github.io)

Overview: Worked in a group of 4 to research past pandemics, epidemics, and seasonal flu to develop a website with interactive, up-to-date plots and maps comparing them to COVID-19. New and cumulative case and death data was collected, wrangled, and analyzed to make adequate comparisons of COVID-19 to the seasonal flu (Influenza B), past pandemics (H1N1 and Spanish Flu), and the original coronavirus epidemic from 2003 (SARS-CoV-1). 

Data: Collected from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the World Health Organization (WHO), and Kaggle.

Results: Pandemic trends were studied to assess future implications of COVID-19, and the basic reproductive rate, $R_0$, was found to be higher for COVID-19 than all of the other diseases studied. 

Software: RStudio and GitHub were used in collaborative construction of the website. 

## Creating a Linear Model for Factors that Impact Hate Crimes in the U.S. in 2016 

Download Report: [Linear Model of Hate Crimes in the U.S. in 2016](biostats_proj.pdf)

Overview: Worked in a group of 5 to study the covariates most closely associated with hate crimes in the U.S. in 2016, construct a linear model to explain these factors, and then compile a publishable report. 

Data: Collected from the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), and the U.S. Census Bureau.

Results: The findings suggested that Gini index of income inequality, percent of population with at least a high school education, and unemployment were the factors highest associated with hate crimes in the U.S. in 2016. 

Software: RStudio and GitHub were used in collaborative construction of the linear model and report.
